// parent class can have multiple child classes -->  Person had Singer, Dancer, Programmer, etc. 
// HOWEVER --> child classes can have ONLY ONE parent class -->  Singer had only Person 


// class Assistant extends Person, Singer  
// Classes can only extend a single class --> can't have more than one, classes can ONLY extend a single class 
// if there is no present constructor --> defaults to constructor in your class in case you don't create one [and does not need super as well]
