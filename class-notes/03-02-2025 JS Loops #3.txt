Loops: 

1. for loop (1995) --> usually useful if you need indexes of something [there's a set range]
2. while loop (1997) --> if you DON'T know the range
3. do while loop --> runs at least once [diff. between do while & while]
4. for...of loop [for each loop] --> (2015) ES6 update [like arrow functions + let + const + spread operator + etc. ]
    - used to iterate through iterable objects [arrays + objects + maps + sets + etc.]
5. for...in loop 

Maps, Sets [also an ES6 feature] 

* When to use for loop vs. for...of loop to iterate arrays *
- for...of loop CAN'T manipulate the index/range --> cannot modify your start/end point 

Useful Array elements [other ways to loop your array elements] ==> forEach(), map(), filter(), reduce(), some(),, every(), first()
