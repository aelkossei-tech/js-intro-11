- sense the other side of the interview --> feel out their personality 
- answers should be detailed + use their own syntax/diction within your own answer 

- push your code to GitHub repositories from now on for homework 


02 - Create a GitHub Account 

    UserName: aelkossei-tech
    Email: ayahelkossie@gmail.com

Here's the GitHub "Manual" --> https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 
git config --global user.name "aelkossei-tech"
git config --global user.email ayahelkossie@gmail.com
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

Run below command to check global information
git config --list 


03 - Generating SSH Public Key 
    SSH = Secure Shell used for authentication 





** Highly recommend to read the different pages on GitHub Docs **

- Get to HOME directory ==> Command + Shift + H
- Reveal hidden folders ==> Command + Shift + . 

TASK - A: 

pushing code: publishing/sharing your code with others
pulling code: retrieving/getting others code into your local 

GIT (Global Information Tracker)
    - software for tracking changes in any set of files and usually used for coordinating work
    among programmers to collaboratively develop the source code
VCS (Version Control System) [Umbrella term]
    - system of records' changes to a file/set of files over time so that you can recall specfic
    versions later 
    - Distrubted VS. Centralized 
        - main difference between the two --> one has everything centralized in the server [centralized] + 
        we'd have a copy within local (we'd be working with local copy before staging it and pushing code)
        - Distrubted ==> local repositories added for each user
            - you have a local copy 
            --> commit your changes to a local repository (staging area)
                - git commit -m "notes"
            --> and THEN push to the master branch [NEVER work directly in master branch]
        - Centralized ==> one central server and many users 
            - repository not locally available + always needs to be connected to a network
            to perform any action 
            - not preferred because you'd need a constant connection between server and workspace/
            PC in order to push code


*** NOTE: ***
When creating new repositories on GitHub and linking them with your local
projects/folders/etc. --> Do NOT use HTTPS

We will use SSH for authentication

Creating a SSH (Secure Shell): 
    - Another way for authentication
    - How to create SSH: 
        1. ssh-keyen 
            - Private SSH file is in your local 


HOW TO CREATE AND PUSH A NEW PROJECT FROM LOCAL TO REMOTE: 
1. Create a project on local (laptop)

2. Create a remote repo (GitHub repo)

3. Initialize your local project with GIT 
    git init 

4. Link your local project with remote repo 
    git remote add origin <remote-url>

5. Stage the changes
    git add <file-name> 
    git add . 

6.  Commit the changes with a meaningful message 
    git commit - m "message"

7. Publish your changes/ push 
    git push 

GIT PUSH - existing local repository 
First time for the branch: Use one of the below 
git ush --set-upstream origin master
git push -u origin master

Later: git push 

- Figure out how to solve on your own first before asking other people
