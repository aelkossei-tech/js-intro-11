TEST CASE REVIEW MEETING
    - scheduled for QA Team and PO to go over draft test cases to make sure all the acceptance criteria is covered 
      by draft test cases 


If you don't have much to do at the beginning of sprint? Do below: 
    - Prioritize the tasks that you have and complete the most important 
    - Start writing your template test scripts and update them once actual development is ready 

** Do you have experience with SHIFT-LEFT TESTING or TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT? ** 
    - MAIN IDEA --> DO testing as early as possible!
SHIFT-LEFT TESTING ==> it's related to Test-Driven Development 
    - Write your scripts first 
    - Run scripts (all fails)
    - Develop the feature 
    - Update and run scripts again (passes)



** Tell me about your sprint? ** 
** What are the roles and responsibilities you have in a sprint? **
** What do you do in a regular sprint? ** 
(All of them are the same question - answer in 3 parts)

    - 1st Couple Days: 
        - Read and understand requirements (AC) of the PBIs/User Stories assigned to me. 
        - Write your draft test cases (prepare RTM)
        - Do Test Case review meeting and get approved 
        - SOME ADDITIONALS: Create test data if needed + complete tech-debt for previous sprint (automation usually) + run regression for QA
        enviroments 

    - Mid-Sprint: 
        - Developer finishes their tasks and I manually run my test cases that I created (at the beginning of the sprint)
        - If I can start with automation for the past manual tests, then I write scripts 
        - Report bugs if you come across any while testing. 

    - Last Couple Days: 
        - Prioritize work and complete most important ones 
        - Automate as much as possible and leave very less tech-debt to next sprint 

    WHILE DOING ALL OF THIS --> join all the Scrum ceremonies + communicate/collaborate w/ your team members + do documentation + create your pull 
        requwsts and follow up w/ reviews + resolve conflicts + resolve feedbacks + compelte your PR + delete your branch + pull the changes to local
