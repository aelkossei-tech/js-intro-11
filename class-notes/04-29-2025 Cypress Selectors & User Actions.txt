RECAP: 
    - Absolute and Relative XPath 
    - CSS --> tag + id(unique) + class()
        - properties (attributes) --> id/class/etc. 
    * Rewatch the recap just to understand the child-parent relationship and how to navigate throughout it 
    - Adjacent Sibling Selector ==> + 
    - Only use , --> if you want from diff. locations from the web page [not related - no connections]

What are diff. ways to locate elements w/ Cypress? 
    - XPath & CSS locators (tags + id + class + attributes + text + etc.)
        - ** XPath ** 
    - to fetch the HTML element in Cypress ==> cy.get(); 
    - in Cypress --> aliases can be assigned to web elements ==> cy.as(); 
        - aliases help with referencing elements easily + avoids repetitive usage of selectors 
        - when using an alias ==> use @ 

** Look up Pseudo Class --> might come up in interview as well **
