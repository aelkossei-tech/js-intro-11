    - frontend ==> UI (User Interface) of the application --> developed using JS mainly (in addition to other tools)
    - API (Application Programming Interface) [REST, SOAP, GRAPHQL]
    - backend ==> Server and Database(DB)

ES6 (ES2015) 

Before ES6: JS was commonly used for web development (frontend)
    - Backend Developers: Java, .NET/C#, Ruby, GO, JavaScript

After ES6: JS can be used for backend development as well. 


*** ES6: Interviews Questions *** 
1. Tell me some new features added w/ ES6?* 
  - Mention at least 5 of these and explain what they are when asked 
    --> let-const     
    --> for...of loop 
    --> arrow functions 
    --> string templates/interpolation 
    --> spread operator 
    --> default parameters 
    --> rest parameters
    --> classes
    --> promises (async - await)
    --> Map, Set 


2. Can you tell me how many different ways you can create functions in JavaScript? 
    1. function declaration
    2. function expression 
    3. arrow function 
    4. constructor function 
    5. IIFE
    6. Recursive functions ==> a concept that a function invokes itself within its body 
        // There is an infinite loop for below execution 
        EX: function printHi(){
            printHi(); 
        }
        printHi(); 


Default parameters ==> allows you to assign a default value for a function parameter (if no argument is provided when the function is called)

What's the difference between spread operator and the rest parameter? 
const arr = [1, 3, 4]; 

...arr --> this will spread array elements into individual values 

function funcName(...rest) { // ...rest will collect individual arguments in an array 

}

Vanilla JS = pure JS (w/o the use of libraries)
