What is Scrum and what are Scrum roles?

Scrum is a way to manage projects by breaking work into small, manageable pieces called sprints (usually 1–4 weeks). 
It helps teams deliver work quickly and make changes based on feedback.

    - an agile, management process/framework that allows us to focus on delivering the highest business value in the shortest amount of time 
        - OR an agile framework that breaks down larger projects into smaller, more manageable parts (sprints)
    - sprints ==> a defined period (typically 1 - 4 weeks - 2 being the most common) where the development team focuses on 
        completing a set of tasks to deliver a usuable product 

Scrum roles: 
  a. Product Owner – Decides what to build next and manages the product backlog.
    - *** defines the product vision + builds/manages/prioritizes the backlog + represents the stakeholders ** 
    - ensures the development team delivers the most value to the business [link between the Scrum team and the businnes ]
    - understand/prioritize the changing needs of end users/customers 
    - champions of their products

  b. Scrum Master/Scrum Leader – Makes sure the team follows Scrum and helps remove any obstacles.  
    - coaches the team + faciliates the Scrum process + removes impediments/obstacles + ensures the team follows the agreed-upon practices 
    - accountable for the team's effectiveness 

  c. Development Team (Developers & QA) – The people who actually build the product.
    - responsible for delivering potentially shippable incremenets at the end of each sprint 

    - w/ a Scrum team --> there's no hiearchies; everyone's working towards one goal [the Product Goal] together 

2. Tell me about Scrum artifacts.
    - it's important information used by the Scrum team that helps define the product & what work needs to be done to create the product 

    - Scrum has three main artifacts (tools used in Scrum to solve problems & manage projects):
         a. Product Backlog – A dynamic list of everything (features/requirements/enhancements/fixes) that needs to be done for the project, managed/maintained/uodated by the Product Owner.

          b. Sprint Backlog – The list of tasks the (development) team plans to finish during the current sprint.

         c. Increment – The working product (or piece of software) that the team finishes by the end of the sprint.
            - a step towards a goal/vision

3. Tell me about Scrum Ceremonies.

Scrum ceremonies are essential meetings that help the team stay organized and stick to the Scrum framework. There are several 
types of Scrum ceremonies, which include: 
    
    a. Sprint Planning – The team plans what they will work on in the sprint.

    b. Daily Scrum (or Stand-up) – A quick daily meeting to check in on progress and discuss any problems.

    c. Sprint Review – At the end of the sprint, the team shows what they’ve completed to get feedback.

    d. Sprint Retrospective – The team talks about what went well and what can be improved for the next sprint.
