INSTANCE vs. STATIC
class Mercedes {
    brand = 'Mercedes'; 
}

const car1 = new Mercedes(); 
const car2 = new Mercedes(); 
car1.color = 'Black'; 
car2.color = 'White'; 


SORTING ARRAYS: 
- w/ string: they will be sorted alphabetically(lexicographically)
- w/ number: from smallest to largest 

ASCENDING ORDER: smallest to largest (a - b)
DESCENDING ORDER: largest to smallest (b - a)

// [1, 40, 15, 20, 2]; 

numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b); 

a      b       a - b         result      memory 
1      40      1 - 40        negative    1 should be listed earlier than 40 
40     15      40 - 15       positive    40 should be listed later 50 


INTERVIEW QUESTION: 

[[2, 4, 56], [2, 100, 5]]
Math.max(...[[2, 4, 56], [2, 100, 5]].flat()); // 100
