What is a locator?
    - locators ==> used to select a specific element in the DOM tree 
    - automation tools rely on locators to find almost every component/element on the webpage 
    - they're important --> 1. precision in action 2. fluidity of web  3. efficiency and speed 
    - automation testers should accurately engage w/ these web elements 
    - good test automation isn't only about creating tests/writing scripts --> it's also making sure that those scripts 
      work well, even websites change. 

Types of Locators: 
    - Two Types of Locators: XPath & CSS
    1. XPath [XML Path Language] ==> query-based syntax for XML schema and HTML documents that testers use
        to traverse [travel across or through] elemetns within the document 

    2. CSS [Cascading Style Sheets] ==> type of locators where it follows the string representation of HTML 
        elements/attributes/classes 
        - like XPath, follows specific syntax for the selector expressions 
        - helps to find elements on the webpage uniquely

** What should you do about node_modules? (especially in a job environment) **
** What is npm/npx? What is Node.js? ** 
* Get better at HTML/CSS/DOM --> especially when trying ro find locators when testing 

- class ==> . 
- id ==> #
