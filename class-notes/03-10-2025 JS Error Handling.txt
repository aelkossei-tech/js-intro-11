- Universal to all other programming languages 

Error Handling ==> the process of dealign with these errors in a controlled/graceful manner to prevent them from causing 
                   the entire 



Errors ==> unexpected results, most probably caused by programmers' codes 
     1. Errors we can handle/fix with our code
        a. Checked (syntax errors) (complite-type errors) --> You SEE the error before you run the code 
        b. Unchecked (runtime errors) --> You see these errors when you run the code [until you run, everything looks good]

     2. Errors: caused by server, network, loads 

EX:
if(websiteLoads){
    // show users website
}
else {
    // show a nice picture with 404 Not Found message 
}

Custom Errors ==> allows us to throw an error (create your own errors) using throw keyword
