'Hello, today is Monday and we learn regex'; 
5 character followed with a space []

/e/.test('Hello'); ==> does this pattern match "Hello"
/apple/.test('Apple is recognized world wide.'); // false, bc. there's no 'i' 
/apple/i.test('Apple is recognized world wide.'); // true 

/[abc]/.test('Hello'); // false
/[abc]/.test('apple'); // true

/[0-9]/.test('ab1c); // true  ==> same thing as /\d/ [all digits]
/[a-z]/                       ==> same thing as /\W/ [all the words]
/[A-Z]/
/[0-9a-zA-z]/ 

/\s/ --> anything matching one space
/\s+/ --> anything matching more than one space

e_g       -> egg eng 
/e.g/     --> . is like saying I don't care about these characters 

Call out specific function ==> CharacterHelper.(whatever function from the object --> isDigit, etc.)
