*** What is 'IS A RELATIONSHIP' vs 'HAS A RELATIONSHIP'?

IS A RELATIONSHIP = inheritance w/ parent-child relationship 

class Animal {
	
}
class Dog extends Animal {
	
}
class GermanShepherd extends Dog {
	
}
GermanShepherd is a Dog
GermanShepher is an Animal


HAS A RELATIONSHIP = it is NOT inheritance BUT --> one class uses another class as a property 

class Car{
	constructor(engine) {
	}
}
class Engine {
	
}
