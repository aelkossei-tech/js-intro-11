Loops: are used to to run a block of code repeatedly 
Iteration: each time that loop runs 

There are 5 loops in JS (Typescript as well) ==> 1. for loop   2. for...of loop  3. for...in loop   4. while loop   5. do while loop 

1. for loop: [Traditional loop, or i loop]
SYNTAX: 
for(initialization; termination condition; update){
    // block to execute 
}

EX: 
 for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    //
 }

LOGICAL MISTAKES: 
    - a loop that NEVER runs    
        for(let i = 1; i < 0; i++){  ---> i < 0 condition will be false for the first iteration and will NOT run
            console.log('SATURDAY'); 
        }
    
    - infinite loops [when you NEVER meet your termination point]
        for(let i = 10; i > 1; i++){   ---> i > 1 will NEVER be false, SO this loop will never stop 
            console.log('SATURDAY'); 
        }
        - also if you have an empty for loop --> Infinite loop 




{
    // block of code
    console.log('Hello'); 
}

// getting each character in a string 
{
    str[i]; 
}

// getting each element from array
{
    arr[i]; 
}

// getting each key-value pairs from object 
{
    //we'll learn this 
}


When to use while loops over for loops: 
- When the exact iteration is unknown 
    - for loops KNOW how many iterations
    - while loops' have UNKNOWN iterations/ranges 

47.5% for loop
47.5% for...of loop(especially with arrays/objects/other iterables)
3% while loop
1% do-while loop 
1 % for...in loop


2. while loop ==> it works with a condition. 
    - The loop will run while the condition is true. 
    - The loop will terminate whenever condition is false
    NOTE: it first checks the condition and then decides whether to run the block or not 
    - SYNTAX: 
        while(condition){
            //run this block 
        }

3. do-while loop ==> it works with a condition. 
    - The loop will run while the condition is true. 
    - The loop will terminate whenever condition is false
    NOTE: The block of code in do block will execute first and then the condition will be checked 
    - SYNTAX: 
        do {
            // run this block
        } while(condition);
