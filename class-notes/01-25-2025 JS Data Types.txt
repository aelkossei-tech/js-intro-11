String 

'John Doe' 
"Chicago"
'      ' ==> still a string 
' '  ===> still a string [empty string]


+ operator
1. concatenation (string) --> EX: '3" + 3 = 33
2. addition (arithmatic operator )

let price = ('2149.99')/2 ; // would get NaN; can't work because the first number is a string -> so you'd need to convert it to a number using parseFloat
let price = parseFloat('2149.99')/ 2; 
            OR 
let price = Number('2149.99')/2 // would get the same thing as parseFloat


Booelan 
- has two values: true and false


TRUTHY and FALSY statements: 

true

false, null, undefined, 0, ' '(empty string), NaN(not a number)

*** What's the difference between null and undefined? ***
Undefined is for variables that are declared, but not assigned with a value yet. 
Null is used intentionally to point absence of data. 

Required

What are primitives?
Number, String, Null, Undefined, Boolean ==> DON"T intitally say an exact number 

Array --> considered a collection [similar things in a group]
Collection: 

JS is a dynamically typed 
let smth; // undefined 

smth = 5; // numbers

smth = 'John'; //string 

smth = []; //object

smth = null; //object 

Statically typed languages (complied languages) [TS, Java, C#]
let name = 'John'; (String)
name = 'James'; //allowed
name = 5; //Syntax Error 

Java:
String name = "John"; 
name = 5; // Syntax Error 

Getting first-last elements from an array 
first is --> [0] 
second is --> [1]

last  --> arr[arr.length - 1 ]
second from the last --> arr[arr.length - 2]

How to create an array?
-- We can use array literals with [] or new Array () constructor
1. const arr = [1, 2, 3, etc.]
2. const arr = new Array (1, 2, 3);
