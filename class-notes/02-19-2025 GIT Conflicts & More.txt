GIT CONFLICT
==> When 2 or more team members work on same files and they push their codes and merge it to remote/main OR remote/master 
- Conflict happens because you didn't pull the latest 
remote/master OR remote/main changes 


CONFLICTs happen and we need to resolve them.
1. If it is a small conflict --> just resolve it inline (Github, etc.)
2. If it is complex --> pull the last changes to your local, merge it to your branch 
    ==> this will create same conflicts in your local, resolve them and push the changes
    once again

sprint: a period of time (2 weeks)
3-5 branches 
7-10 commits
3-5 PRs
3-5 Pull changes 

Miscellaneous 
1. Can I rename my branch? How to name branches? 
    TASKID-description 
    TASKID-description-jdoe 
    EX: TGM123 [depends on company's preference + project management tools]
    EX: 456346-dashboard-tests 

    EX: git branch 456347-dashboard-tests 
        git checkout 456347-dashboard-tests 
        git branch -m 45637-dashboard-smoke(edit)-tests ==> git branch -m editedBranchName

2. Can I switch to another branch without committing my changes?
    - Yes, you techinically can (it will still show up)--> HOWEVER it's better for you to commit anyways
    - It's recommended to commit your changes and then switch 

3. Can I merge my local branches? 
    - Yes 
     --> first switch to your branch that you want to merge all the changes 
     --> Then use below command to merge the other branch into current branch
                 - [git merge] intendedBranchName
      - Visual Editor (VI) --> i , escape + :wq ==> Commit message 

4. Can I switch to my team member's branch?
    Yes, you can. 
    You'd use [git fetch] --> it updates your local with all the remote branches 

5. Can I pull my team member's changes without PR into master?
    git fetch 
    git checkout origin/</banch-name>
        - You can do changes in this branch
        - Then you can commit and push changes 

6. What happens if I forget to commit message?
    - You'll get Visual Editor (VI) to add your commit message
    - You can type your commit messgae while in insert mode and then exit

        q --> quit
        wq --> sabe & quit

7. Can I change the commit message before I push?
    - Yes, you can. --> [git commit --amend] OR [git ammend -m "New commit message"]

8. What is git stash and git stash apply?
    - It's a way to resolve conflicts that are obvious 
        1. I did some changes with a local branch
        2. Then someone updated remote master and I know if I push my code, it will create 
        3. Stash my changes: [git stash]
        4. Switch to master in your local 
        5. Pull the changes from remote master: [git pull]
        6. Swtich back to your own local branch (your stashed changes)
        7. Merge locla master changes into your local branch
        8. Retrieve stashed changes: [git stash apply]
        9. This is going to create conflicts
        10. Resolve them, and puclish your branch


9. What is git fetch, git merge, and git pull? Their differences?  [** INTERVIEW QUESTION **]
    - There are 2 ways to update your local branches with remote branches 
    - Case of master branch 
        1. switch to master in your local and run [git pull]
        2. switch to master in your local and run [git fetch] to retrive all the changes without merge + And 
        then [run git merge origin.master] to update your local master with


10. What else I should know about GIT commands?
