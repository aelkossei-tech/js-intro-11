Video #1: Cypress Introduction: 
    - What is Cypress? 
        ==> an automation tool that helps us automate any browser application; End-to-End (E2E) Testing Tool 
        - helps us to automate the browser + gives an opportunity to automate APIs [before there were diff. multiple libraries to do this]
        - next-generation front=end testing tool constructed for modern web 
        - tool addresses the critical pain points developers/QAs used to face when testing modern apps. [like synchronization issues + test inconsistencies]
        - built on Node.js  + comes packaged as an npm module 
        - since it's based on Node.js --> uses only JS for writing tests
        - bundles w/ jQuery (JS library) + inherit manys jQuery methods 
        - We're learning Cypress because: 
            1. Speed & Reliability --> delivers fast/reliable test execution b/c of architectural design 
                - Cypress runs tests in the browser + provides instant feedback
